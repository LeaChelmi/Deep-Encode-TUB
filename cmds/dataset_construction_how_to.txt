data set construction instructions

1. dependencies:

	ffmpeg
	scenedetect: http://scenedetect.com/en/latest/download/


2. download raw/uncompressed video(s)

	for example: https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/ -> hd, 4k or full sequences


3. run scenedetect on it (Uncompressed mode!) with this command:

	scenedetect -i <input file> -o <output dir> detect-content split-video -a "-map 0 -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 0 -c:a aac"


4. upload individual scenes to youtube

	get verified to get a daily upload limit of 100 (instead of 10), this may take 24h


5. download videos by just clicking on each video options->download


(6. extract bitrate using ffprobe, with this command

	ffprobe -v error -print_format json -show_entries stream=bit_rate input.mp4>output.json

	--> this will save bitrate of video and audio in output.json. We will have to discuss in what format we ant to have it)
